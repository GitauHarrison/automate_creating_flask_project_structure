# Contributing to the Automated Flask Project Structure Helper

Thank you for your interest in improving the automation script that scaffolds Flask projects. This repository contains the **helper tool**, not the applications it generates. Contributions here should focus on making the tool more robust, clearer, and easier to use.

## Scope of this repository

This repo is about:

- The `create_flask_project.py` script and any supporting code.
- Documentation explaining what the script does and how to use it.
- Example outputs (if you choose to add them) that demonstrate the structure
  created by the helper.

It is **not** the place to report bugs or request features for individual projects that were generated by the script. Those should live in their own application repos.

## Ways to contribute

- Report bugs or unclear behavior in the automation script or docs.
- Suggest improvements to the generated project structure (within reason).
- Improve documentation, comments, and inline explanations in this repo.
- Add or refine tests and validation around the script.

## Getting started

1. **Read the README**
   - Make sure you understand what the helper does today and how it is
     expected to be used.

2. **Set up a development environment**
   - Use `pyenv` + `pyenv-virtualenv` or `pyenv` + `Poetry`, as described in
     the README.
   - Install dependencies needed to run and test the script.

3. **Generate a test project**
   - Run `create_flask_project.py` a few times with different options
     (Poetry workflow, requirements.txt workflow) to see the behavior from a
     user's perspective.

## Contribution guidelines

### 1. Discuss larger changes first

If you want to:

- Change the generated project structure (e.g. new blueprints, different layout),
- Alter how dependencies are suggested or managed,
- Introduce new external tools or opinions,

please open an issue first and describe:

- What you want to change.
- Why it is beneficial.
- How it affects existing users and generated projects.

### 2. Keep changes focused

- Prefer small, self-contained pull requests.
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes (e.g. refactor + feature + style tweaks) in one PR.
- If you need to touch multiple areas (e.g. script + docs), make sure the
  changes are tightly related.

### 3. Code style and structure

- Follow the existing Python style (PEP 8, clear naming, type hints where practical).
- Keep functions and modules focused (single responsibility where possible).
- When changing the generated templates, maintain a balance between readability and minimalism; remember they serve as learning material for users.

### 4. Testing and manual verification

- If you add or change logic in `create_flask_project.py`,
  - Consider adding or updating tests (if a test suite is present).
  - At minimum, **manually** run the script and verify:
    - It still works for both workflows (Poetry and requirements.txt).
    - The generated project can be installed and run following the README
      instructions.
- Be explicit in your PR description about how you tested your changes.

### 5. Commit messages and pull requests

- Use descriptive commit messages that explain the *why* behind a change.
- For pull requests, include:
  - A short summary of what changed.
  - Any relevant issue numbers (e.g. `Fixes #12`).
  - How you tested the changes.

## Using the helper while contributing

If you are working on the helper itself, it is often useful to:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `create_flask_project.py` into a throwaway project name.
3. Inspect the generated project, adjust the script, and repeat.

This feedback loop makes it easier to spot UX issues and rough edges from a
user's point of view.

By following these guidelines, you help keep this automation tool reliable and approachable for developers who want to spin up Flask projects quickly without sacrificing structure or clarity.
